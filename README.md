# Odin Project Starter Template
This is a basic starter template for projects in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It includes the default setup of:

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

---

## How to Use
1. Click the green **"Use this template"** button on this repo
2. Create a **new repository** for your project (e.g. `odin-rock-paper-scissors`)
3. Clone your new repo to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-new-project.git
```

### When to Remove or Update the README

When you generate a new project from this template:
 It’s OK to **leave the README temporarily** — just update it later to reflect the new project.
- Or delete it entirely and write a project-specific one.
